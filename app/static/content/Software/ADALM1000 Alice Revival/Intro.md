## Analog Devices ALM1000 Alice Desktop Revival

The Analog Devices Assited Learning Module 1000 is a 0-5V Power supply and
arbitrary function generator.  It also has voltage and current sensing abilities
making this $30 ish dollar board a great candidate for an all-in-one lab kit.  
This is work done to revival their python based ALICE desktop which has been
replaced by a newer QT application.
