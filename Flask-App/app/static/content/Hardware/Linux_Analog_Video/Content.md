## Linux Analog Video 

#### Overview
Analog video sources are still abudent and are widely used in the world of fpv quadcopters and security cameras.  Single channel analog to digital video USB dongles exist but usb data transmission speeds do not allow for more than two os these to be used concurrently.  Our aim is tim be able to support at least 4 video channels available in a embedded Linux environment.  Current design considerations for achomplishing this are:

* Intersil TW2965 and a Beagle Board black
* Common DVR boards 
* FPGA

#### Intersil

#### DVR Board

#### FPGA

*No work has yet taken place to implement an FPGA solution.  I am aware video based work can be ideal for an FPGA and I would love to pursue the idea further when time permits or if a road block arises in one of the other possible implementations*
